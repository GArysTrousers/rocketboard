# ðŸš€RocketBoard
## What is this?
RocketBoard is a simple digital signage system.

__*File system backend, Browser based frontend.*__

## How do I use it?
There's a few things you'll need to understand to make use of ðŸš€RocketBoard.

- In the webroot, there is a folder called "boards".
- Making a folder inside "boards" creates a board with that name.
- A board will show whatever images are in its folder.
- To display a board, just open a browser to:

      http://[server ip or hostname]/?=[board name]

## How do I customise it?
Feel free to modify the the project however you like, but there is a few built in ways to customise your boards.

- "settings.js" in the webroot contains the settings for slick (the carousel library) and any other future js settings.
- You can also create a new "settings.js" file in a board folder to override settings for that board, such as:

      settings.slickOptions.autoplaySpeed = 1000;
